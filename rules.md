You must read to the end to gain access to the discord.

**Hello and welcome to the Team Jamp discord!**

Team Jamp is a place where makers and players come together and enjoy platforming levels! 

Here are the basics of how everything works, however, I encourage you to explore the discord to find out more specifics and visit our website for even more info (#important-links).


**How do I start?**

To start your jamping adventure, type ``!register nickname``. If you ever want to change your registered name, use ``!nickname``. Then use ``!login`` to login to your account on the website. All of these commands can go in #bot-spam. Then you're on your way :PogJamper: 


**Where do I find other Team Jamp commands**

The commands listed in these rules are just the bare minimum of what our bot can do! 

For a full list of commands and descriptions, please visit https://makerteams.net/features
‎

**Where do I find the levels in Team Jamp?**

A list of levels, as well as numerous other features, will be found on the Team Jamp website (courtesy of Team Shell). If you would like to search for a level in the discord, you can use ``!search levelname``


**How do I submit my clears?**

To submit your clears, you can either use the Team Jamp website directly or use the ``!clear xxx-xxx-xxx`` command in #bot-spam .

In Team Jamp we use point scaling, meaning you might get a higher amount of points depending on how hard the level is. It's roughly graphed like so: ``1=1, 3.5=5, 10=20``

Check the pinned message in #bot-spam for more info


**How do I know how many points I have?** 

To find your point total, you can use ``!points`` and to see a leaderboard, or find your profile on our website.

‎

**How do I submit my level?**

To submit your level, please use ``!add xxx-xxx-xxx level name`` in #level-submissions. The Jamp Judges will then play your level and either approve or reject it. 

_Note that if your level is rejected, we don't require you to reupload the level without the Team Jamp tag, although you can if you want to_

_Also note that there are requirements for submitting levels. You must have 10 points to submit your first level, and an additional 5 for every level following._

Please also use the ``!addtags xxx-xxx-xxx`` command after submission so that other members can sort levels by preference.

For more information about tags and submitting levels, please check the pinned message in #level-submissions

__**How to register in Team Jamp**__
*``!faq 1 / !faq register``*

Before you're able to submit clears and levels, you must type ``!register nickname`` in #bot-spam. Your nickname will then appear on our website under the members tab, and you're all set for the next step :PogJamper:
‎

__**How to login and use Team Jamp's website**__
*``!faq 2 / !faq login``*

Links to useful pages on our website can be found in #important-links. There you can find Team Jamp levels, worlds, leaderboard, and more. If you would like to be able to submit clears on the website, and filter through levels you've already cleared, you'll need to log in to your account. First, make sure you're registered, then use the ``!login`` command in #bot-spam. Make sure you have your DMs open so the bot can send you a link to your account :PogJamper:
‎
__**How to submit clears**__
*``!faq 3 / !faq clears``*

To submit your clears, you can either use the Team Jamp website directly or use the ``!clear xxx-xxx-xxx`` command in #bot-spam. You will also get points for your clears, which will be added to your profile on the leaderboard, and can help you reach higher ranks in the discord. In Team Jamp we use point scaling, meaning you might get a higher amount of points depending on how hard the level is. It's roughly graphed like so: ``1=1, 3.5=5, 10=20``. Additionally, check the pinned message in #bot-spam for extra clear-related commands :PogJamper:
‎
__**How to submit levels**__
*``!faq 4 / !faq levels``*

First, you should read #level-rules so you know what is required in a Team Jamp level. Then use the ``!add xxx-xxx-xxx gameStyle level name`` command in #level-submissions. Your level will then be displayed on the website as 'pending'. Once the judges review the level and hopefully approve it, you will be notified and your level will be officially welcomed into Team Jamp. Additionally, check the pinned message in #level-submissions for extra level-submission-related commands :PogJamper:
‎
__**What is a pending level**__
*``!faq 5 / !faq pending``*

When somebody adds a level, it will be added to the pending queue until 3 Jamp Judges review it. They will each either cast an approve, reject, or fix vote. Note that it might take a while for your level to be reviewed, as we have a lot of levels in the queue. If you submit a clear for a pending level, you won't get any points. However, if/when the level is approved, points will automatically be distributed :PogJamper:

__**If you didn't find what you were looking for in this channel, feel free to ask us!**__

In addition to this channel, we also have a FAQ bot anyone can use to easily reference any FAQ from this channel, in a different channel. If you see anybody asking a question that you know is answered in this channel, you can use the command ``!faq <number or keyword>``, and the bot will provide help. 

Every FAQ on this list has a corresponding number and keyword shown under the FAQ title that you can use in the command. If you need help, you can use ``!faq menu.``
